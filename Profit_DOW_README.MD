## 🛠️ What Was Done  
The project leveraged daily transactional sales data and product subcategories to identify trends in performance by day of the week. The following views were built using Tableau:
- 📅 Total Sales and Return Count by Day of Week
- 🔥 Heatmap of Sales by Category & Sub-Category
- 🧩 Treemap showing % of Sales Contribution per Day and Product
- 🗺️ Choropleth map showing Sales Volume by State

Calculated fields were created for total profit and return counts, and interactive filters for category, sub-category, and return status were added to support deeper exploration.

## 📈 Visual Features  
- 📊 **Bar Graphs**: Show total sales and returns by weekday — Tuesday and Saturday stand out.
- 📋 **Heatmap Table**: Highlights top categories like Phones and Tables by weekday.
- 🧱 **Treemap**: Visualizes percentage share of daily sales by product.

## ✅ Results
