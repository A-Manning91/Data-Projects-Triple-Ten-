# 📦 Return Analysis Dashboard – README

## 🧭 Introduction

The Return Analysis Dashboard investigates customer return behavior to identify key trends by product type, state, customer group, and time of year. The goal is to help businesses reduce return rates, improve inventory management, and optimize fulfillment strategies using real return data.

## 🔍 What Was Done

- **Data Preparation:** Cleaned return data and created calculated fields such as return rate and return flag.
- **Data Analysis:** Explored trends in returns across:
  - **Geography** (State-level return rates)
  - **Product Categories** (Top-returned items)
  - **Customer Patterns** (Repeat return behavior)
  - **Time Trends** (Monthly return fluctuations)
  - **Sales vs Returns** (Do higher sales correlate with more returns?)

- **Visualizations Built in Tableau:**
  1. **Overview Dashboard:** Highlights KPIs, top states, and categories for returns.
  2. **Return Rate by State:** Map with contextual summaries.
  3. **Monthly Return Trends:** Line chart showing seasonal behavior.
  4. **Return Rate by Product:** Bar chart of sub-category return rates.
  5. **Sales vs. Returns Correlation:** Scatterplot with trend line.
  6. **High-Return Customers:** Analysis excluding one-time buyers.
