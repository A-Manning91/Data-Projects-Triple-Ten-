## 🛠️ What Was Done  
Using Tableau, I developed a comprehensive dashboard to analyze:
- 💰 Profit margins per product and sub-category
- 🗓️ Monthly and seasonal sales trends
- 📍 State-wise profitability and return rates
- 🔄 Returned items by sub-category
- 🎯 Ad spend recommendations based on profitability

Interactive filters were added for Region, State, Sub-Category, and Return Status to allow customized insights by audience or market.

## 📊 Visual Features  
- **Top 3 / Bottom 3 Items Sold**: Ranked by profit margin to identify products to prioritize or phase out.
- **Profit by Region & Sub-Category**: Bar charts show detailed profit performance across U.S. regions.
- **Monthly Trends & Top States**: Map and bar chart showing which months and states drive the most average profit per unit.
- **Return Analysis**: Visualizes return rates and quantities for each product group—Office Supplies show the highest return rate.
- **State-Product Profit vs. Returns**: Color-coded map showing return rate alongside average profit per order.
- **Ad Spend Recommendations**: States like Indiana, Minnesota, and Vermont stand out with strong per-unit profits—suggested for increased ad allocation.
